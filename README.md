# Lights-with-Earth

A basic graphics program that displays a sphere with an earth texture, a rotating "moon" object without a texture, 
and 3 light sources; 1 moving point light, 1 stationary point light, and 1 stationary spotlight. 

The earth sphere is intentionally "shiny" and uses GL_FLAT, while the moon sphere is intentionally dull and uses GL_SMOOTH.
